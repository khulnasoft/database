  description: |
    Xilinx which was acquired by AMD and is a company that specializes in the design and
    development of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices
    (PLDs), and adaptive SoC architecture. One of the most popular hardware theyâ€™ve
    manufactured is the VCK5000 which is built on the AMD 7nm Versal adaptive
    system-on-chip architecture. The Versal adaptive SOC is a disruptive 7 nm
    architecture that combines heterogeneous compute engines with a breadth of hardened
    memory and interfacing technologies for superior performance/watt over competing 10
    nm FPGAs . In this context VCK5000 is ideal for CNN, RNN, and NLP acceleration for
    your cloud and edge applications.

  features:
    - "Power efficient."
    - "Flexible for most domain applications."
    - "Readily configurable by both software developers and hardware programmers."
