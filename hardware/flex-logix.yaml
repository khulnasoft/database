    Flex Logix Technologies is a semiconductor startup designing reconfigurable AI
    accelerator chips. They offer EFLX eFPGA, providing a customized array with
    precisely the resources you need, eliminating wastage. Additionally, certain
    portions of an FPGA design are fixed, allowing them to be hardwired into your SoC.

  features:
    - "Keep the flexibility and programmability of your FPGA while cutting power and cost 5-10x."
    - "Graphical user interface compiler and design/debug tools."
    - "eFPGA can enable the parallelism of eFPGA to run workloads like compression faster than the processor."
