  description: |
    The Gaudi acceleration platform was conceived and designed to cater to the training
    and inference requirements of large-scale artificial intelligence applications,
    providing enterprises and organizations with efficient and high-performance deep
    learning computing capabilities. The Gaudi chip is equipped with a powerful GEMM
    engine, serving as a robust computational unit. This engine collaborates with an
    array of tiles, each featuring dedicated local scratchpad memory and a Tensor
    Processing Core (TPC). These TPCs are equipped with vector computation units capable
    of handling operations with 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit precision. Communication
    between TPCs and GEMM Engines is facilitated through DMA and shared memory, while
    they are connected to the host processor via PCIe.

  features:
    - "Designed for efficient scalability."
    - "Can port CUDA to device."
    - "Optimal for training and inference."
    - "First class suppourt for both TensorFlow and Torch."
